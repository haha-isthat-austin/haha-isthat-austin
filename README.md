- 👋 Hi, I’m @haha-isthat-austin
- 👀 I’m interested in ... robotics, interdisciplinary team work, research, politics, 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C, embedded systems, RF, power, cooking in general, control systems, you know and many other EE things
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... b-med interdisciplinary, green energy, small business contracts
- 📫 How to reach me ... ama25@calpoly.edu 

I love cooking, and I love working with and around the institutional guidelines provided from the mediums of making money that have devolved from the 
original intent of currency exchange in rewarding innovation and creation.

Therefore, I would like to become a world-class problem solver and get paid to do it! 

If you have a small business, I'd like to see what kind of solution I could craft for you for compensation if it works out! :D
If you'd like to really call me and get to know who I am, I'd love to connect. 

  Please email me first though, that way no one tries to come and harass me about my car's extended warranty.
